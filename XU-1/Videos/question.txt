Is the plane okay form that last flight? and will the stalling be a problem?


The prop is broken, but the airframe is mostly sound.  It was significantly damaged from the first flight (jim did a loop) and we had to reinforce the nose.  The reinforcements broke again, but are repairable.  We can fly it again as soon as we got more props.
The stalling is due to incompetent pilots.  Jim says it is overpowered, so when it goes vertical and stalls, that is because of the power of the motor.  The lateral stalls are because I don't know how to turn a plane very well.  A little practice will fix all that, and a computer would fix itself from stalling.  


okay was not sure the second video show the stall i was worried about. but it looks to be more successfull then the first flight. how was the frame reinforced

we glued another piece of foamcore to both edges.  It ripped the foam on one side and the bottom, and we taped the bottom.
